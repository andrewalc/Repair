# How much the plant health changes every ticksBeforePlantHealthChanges ticks.
# Added if it's adequately watered, subtracted if it's not.
plantWateredHealthGain: 20

# How many ticks between watered-state-driven health changes for a plant.
ticksBeforePlantHealthChanges: 3

# How much plant matter a plant produces as a multiple of its health.
# e.g. a plant with 120 health will produce 120 * 0.2 = 24 plant matter per tick.
plantMatterHealthMultiplier: 0.2

# Chance that a plant will reproduce to an adjacent square in a tick as a multiple of its health.
plantChanceOfReproducingMultiplier: 0.1
